MIEP: Channel Pruning with Multi-granular Importance Estimation for Object Detection

**Liangwei Jiang**, Jiaxin Chen, Di Huang, Yunhong Yang
- MIEP achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency compared to lightweight object detectors, and generalizes well to various detection frameworks (e.g., Faster-RCNN and FSAF) and tasks (e.g., classification).
<!-- - Under 75% FLOPs reduction, MIEP achieves a 37.0% mAP on GFL with COCO. Specifically, MIEP compresses a 90%-FLOPs reduction in RetinaNet and Faster-RCNN, even retains 74.1% and 76.1% mAP on VOC, respectively. -->
