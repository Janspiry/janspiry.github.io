I am currently a researcher at Alipay. My research interests focus on Generative AI and Efficient Inference.

Before that, I received my master degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University (BUAA), China, in Jan. 2024 and B.E degree from Sichuan University (SCU), China, in Jul. 2021.
